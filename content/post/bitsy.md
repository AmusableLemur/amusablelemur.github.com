This weekend I have played around a bit with [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org/), a
small and simple game engine. The editor is easy to grasp and though the
limited scope of the engine itself might seem limiting there are some very
interesting examples of games made with this.

Personally I did not have as much patience or sense of narrative to create
something as engaging as some other things out there. But I did make a small
thing just for fun where you are [stuck in a room with a cat](/stuck_in_a_room_with_a_cat.html).
