This is a list of things I think everyone interested in programming or just
software craftmanship in general should read. It's a work in progress which
I will be improving on whenever I got the time.

Inspired by Jeff Atwoods "[Recommended Reading for Developers][0]". (His list is
way better than mine by the way, so check it out.)

In no particular order.


## Books

**The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master**  
by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas ([Amazon][1])

**The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering**  
by Frederick Brooks ([Amazon][2])

**The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses** by Eric Reiss ([Amazon][3])  
The Lean Startup brings the principles of lean manufacturing and agile
programming to entrepreneurs. An awesome guide on how to do more with less.

**Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code** by Martin Fowler ([Amazon][4])  
Because 99% of programming is maintaining existing code.

**Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** by Gamma et. al (i.e. "Gang of Four")

## Articles

**The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code**  
This article is 15 years old now but is still very much relevant today. By
simply answering each question with yes or no it's really damn easy to get a
good understanding of how good a team actually is.

**What is Code?**  
While more a book than an article this piece by Paul Ford does a better job than
many to illustrate what software engineering really is about and how it came to
be.

## Other stuff

**Programming is terrible**  
A talk by tef on his experiences working as a programmer. He covers a lot of
interesting stuff like best practices, differences between successful
programmers and good ones, myths of programming etc. All in all it's a very
amusing and informative way to spend forty minutes.

**The Codeless Code**  
<http://thecodelesscode.com/contents>

**Paul Graham's Essays**  
Paul Graham have co-founded Viaweb and YCombinator and is famous for his work on
Lisp. Although his site isn't technically a blog, it features some very good
articles.

**Unlearn your MBA**  
David Heinemeier Hansson who famously created Ruby on Rails while
studying for his MBA talks business, management and programming.
