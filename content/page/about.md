My name is Rasmus and I am the CTO at [Emerse](https://www.emerse.com/?utm_source=rasmus) where I build whatever is next in programmatic advertising. I lead a small team were we find simple solutions to difficult problems.

This blog is mostly set up as a writing exercise for me, I hope to improve my writing by forcing myself to write semi-regularly and in front of an audience. It also serves as a way for me to create an online presence and show of some of my work. I try to keep my posts short and worthwile, the first bit is easy.
